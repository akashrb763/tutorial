        all women pregnancy and the birth of a child represents a time of change, in identity and role, as well as physiology. It is also a time of emotional change which for some women may be experienced as a substantial upheaval and for others as more of a change in the balance of emotions (Green, Citation1990). Since its inception, many of the papers published in the journal have explored these issues using a range of methodologies and some of those in this edition have also chosen this area on which to focus.

        The loss of pre-pregnancy self and the gradual, but dramatic changes in maternal shape and size in the course of pregnancy, the associated changes in body image (Clark et al., Citation2009) and the images provided by ultrasound examinations all present women both with the physical evidence of what is happening and function as drivers for psychological adjustment to and reassessment of their new situation. The birth experience, associated interventions and the new baby itself are similarly markers of further transitions and drivers for yet more change and adjustment.
        
        Becoming a parent for many women is hugely enjoyable and a reason for pride, despite the routine needs of infant and childcare (Green & Kafetsios, Citation1997), while for others it is more of a struggle, depending on individual circumstances, resources, the quality of the partner relationship and wider social and emotional support. Adjustment to pregnancy, potential parenthood and becoming a parent takes time. The pathways to motherhood are individual ones, and the timing too, although there are commonalities and some generalisations that can be made.
        
        While women react in different ways, minorities become anxious or depressed and some are both anxious and depressed, although the majority are neither of these things. However, mood changes are common and are likely to have a variable time course. Pre-existing mental health problems are associated with their continuing or re-occurrence during pregnancy and postpartum. For some women there is also a marked change in physical health and well-being, with somatic and other health symptoms more commonly occurring in different age groups (Klemetti, Kurinczuk, & Redshaw, Citation2011).
        
        The way that motherhood is valued in any society impacts on how women see themselves and how others react to them. In many societies motherhood is seen as an essential and natural development and is associated with identity as an adult. For women who are childless by choice, the perception is commonly that are not doing what is expected for selfish reasons and that that they will remain unfulfilled (Woollett, Citation1991).
        Chakku Kazgd, [10-06-2024 09:41 PM]
Women who are not childless by choice and who may have sought help with their situation are perceived as having ‘failed’ in being able to take on this key responsibility.
        
        For women who do have children, apart from the psychosocial issues fundamental to taking on this new role, changes in the couple relationship and the pleasures and frustrations of being a new mother, there are other issues arising from the way that the work of childrearing is perceived, the need for income arising from paid work and the changes in status and career development possibilities that are associated with having and caring for young children. </p></h6>
